## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
