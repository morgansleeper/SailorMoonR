## Install

``` r
devtools::install_github("morgansleeper/SailorMoonR")
```

## Usage

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to
GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and
a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
